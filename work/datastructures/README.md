# Data Structures

Implementation and analysis of fundamental and advanced data structures in C++.

## Core Data Structures

- Arrays and Dynamic Arrays
- Linked Lists (Single, Double, Circular)
- Stacks and Queues
- Hash Tables and Hash Maps
- Trees (Binary, BST, AVL, Red-Black, B-trees)
- Heaps (Min, Max, Fibonacci)
- Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
- Tries and Suffix Trees

## Advanced Structures for HFT

- Lock-free data structures
- Cache-efficient structures
- Memory pools and custom allocators
- Skip lists
- Segment trees and Fenwick trees

## Implementation Notes

- Focus on time and space complexity
- Consider cache performance
- Document thread-safety considerations
- Include benchmark comparisons
