- Great for hands-on practice

### Rustlings
https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
- Small exercises to get used to reading and writing Rust
- Interactive and fun

### The Rust Reference
https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/
- Detailed language reference

## Books

### For Beginners
- **"Programming Rust" by Jim Blandy & Jason Orendorff** (O'Reilly)
  - Great for C++ developers
  - Deep dive into concepts

### For Systems Programming

## Comparison with C++

### Articles
- "From C++ to Rust" guides
- "Rust vs C++ performance" benchmarks
- Memory safety comparisons

### Key Differences to Understand
- RAII vs Ownership/Borrowing
- Smart pointers (C++) vs Box/Rc/Arc (Rust)
- Templates (C++) vs Generics (Rust)
- Exceptions (C++) vs Result/Option (Rust)
- Move semantics differences

## Community

### Forums and Chat
- r/rust subreddit
- Rust Users Forum (users.rust-lang.org)
- Rust Discord
- Rust Zulip

### Stay Updated
- This Week in Rust (newsletter)
- Rust Blog (blog.rust-lang.org)
- RFCs (github.com/rust-lang/rfcs)

## For HFT/Performance Focus

### Low-Latency Rust
- Understanding zero-cost abstractions
- SIMD in Rust
- Benchmarking with Criterion
- Profile-guided optimization
- Memory layout and cache efficiency

### Libraries to Know
- `rayon` - Data parallelism
- `crossbeam` - Concurrency utilities
- `tokio` - Async runtime
- `serde` - Serialization
- `criterion` - Benchmarking

## Documentation Skills

### Learn to Read Docs
- docs.rs - All crate documentation
- Use `cargo doc --open` for local docs
- Understanding trait documentation
- Reading type signatures

## Next Steps

1. Start with **The Rust Book** chapters 1-10
2. Do **Rustlings** exercises alongside
3. Solve 5-10 **Exercism** problems
4. Build a small project (CLI tool recommended)
5. Re-implement a C++ project in Rust
